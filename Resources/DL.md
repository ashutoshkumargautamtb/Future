from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, Flatten, Dense, BatchNormalization

model = Sequential()

# First Convolutional Block
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))

# Second Convolutional Block
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), padding='same', activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))

# Fully Connected Layers
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

### **e. Compilation and Training**

**Compile the Model:**
```python
model.compile(
    loss='categorical_crossentropy',
    optimizer='adam',
    metrics=['accuracy']
)
```

**Train the Model:**
```python
history = model.fit(
    datagen.flow(X_train, y_train, batch_size=64),
    steps_per_epoch=X_train.shape[0] // 64,
    epochs=50,
    validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
    callbacks=[
        tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=10, restore_best_weights=True),
        tf.keras.callbacks.ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', factor=0.5, patience=5)
    ]
)
```

### **f. Evaluation**

**Assess Model Performance:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Evaluate on Test Data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=2)
print(f"Test Accuracy: {test_acc*100:.2f}%")

# Plot Training & Validation Accuracy
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Train Acc')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Val Acc')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Accuracy')

    'batch_size': [32, 64],
    'epochs': [20, 50],
    'optimizer': ['adam', 'rmsprop'],
    'dropout_rate': [0.3, 0.5]
}
grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=model, param_grid=param_grid, n_jobs=-1, cv=3)
grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best: {grid_result.best_score_} using {grid_result.best_params_}")
```

### **h. Deployment (Simplified)**
