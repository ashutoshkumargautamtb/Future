To solidify your understanding, let’s walk through a high-level example of building a supervised learning model using Python and scikit-learn.

### **a. Problem Definition**

**Objective:** Predict housing prices based on various features (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms).

**Type:** Regression

### **b. Data Collection**

- **Dataset:** Use the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing) (Note: Ensure to use updated and ethical datasets as Boston Housing is deprecated due to ethical concerns).

### **c. Data Preprocessing**

1. **Load Data:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

   boston = load_boston()
   df = pd.DataFrame(boston.data, columns=boston.feature_names)
   df['PRICE'] = boston.target
   ```

2. **Handle Missing Values:**
   ```python
   df.isnull().sum()
   # If there are missing values, handle them (e.g., imputation)
   df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
   ```

3. **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
   ```python
   X = df.drop('PRICE', axis=1)
   y = df['PRICE']
   ```

4. **Train-Test Split:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
print(f"R² Score: {r2}")
```

**Interpret Results:**

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

rf = RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5]
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, scoring='r2')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(f"Best Parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")
best_rf = grid_search.best_estimator_
```

### **g. Deployment (Simplified)**

**Serialize the Model:**
```python
import joblib

joblib.dump(best_rf, 'random_forest_model.joblib')
```

**Load and Use the Model:**
```python
model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.joblib')
